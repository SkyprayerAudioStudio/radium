; Sas-C does not do any 64 bit integer operations,
; at least not that I know of. PEQ_calc.c needs
; 64 bit types. This file contains a function that
; multiplies two 32 integers, and divide it by another
; 32 bit number. The result of the 2 32 bit integers
; that are to be multiplied is often more than 64 bit.
; This function can not be run on a 68000 cpu. When
; Compiling for 68000 or 68060 cpu, PEQ_calc_64bit.c is used
; instead. (not very likely that anyone wants to use
; this program on an 68000 cpu, but I made the PEQ_calc_64bit
; function before I knew it was possible to divide
; 64bit numbers directly. Function is used when compiling
; for 68020, 68030 and 68040. Not 68060 as that one
; is much slower than Mul32Div64_000, because 64 bits divs (and muls)
; is emulated.

;Works like:

_Mul32Div64_020:
	muls.l	d1,d1:d0
	divs.l	d2,d1:d0
