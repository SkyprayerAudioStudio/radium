* There are two types of API functions:
  1. Those that takes care of undo/redo and graphics
  2. Those that doesn't.

  * They need have different names somehow. For instance by a prefix for
  the function names in type 1 or 2. (type 1 seems most natural, since
  type 2 are the ones used in scripts, while type 1 are usually only called via
  key bindings or menues.)

  * Type 2 doesn't take care of undo/redo. Suggestion:
    * Scripts must first tell radium which tracks/blocks/etc. that are going to be changed.
    * The functions in type 2 checks that the tracks/blocks/etc. that are manipulated, are really marked.
      If the script tries to manipulate something else, radium will refuse to do so + call RWarning.
      * No, if not, radium can just add that track/block/etc. into the current list of undo.
        The point about telling which track/block/etc. is going to be changed, is just to speed
        up situations where, for instance, you add 1000 notes to a track. Undoing that track 1000
        times is extremely inefficient.
        * But if that track is already in the undo list, why does it have to be added the next 999 times too?


* Updating the "LPB" and "BPM" text seems to just draw over the old graphics.

* The width for line numbers are too small when loading 1.rad.

* When loading a new song, the old editor window isn't closed.
  (When enabling GC again, this might crash the program. I guess there is no pointer
  to the data displayed in the window?)
  No, the extra window is actually functional. Guess it's just not removed from the
  list of edtor windows.

* Doesn't seem to work changing the slider values of midi effects in the midi properties window.
  Not volume either.

* Fix saving. (loading is probably broken as well now after midi refactoring)

* When loading standard midi files, track velocities should be set to max.

* 1LZ, 1MR, etc. (could ask when selecting via menues)

* Instrument->Add doesn't do anything. (No command option for menu menues)

* If making temponode area very big, and thn make window very small,
  then there's lots of warnings. Not unlikely to crash.
  Options:
    * Refuse to make window smaller
    * Make temponodearea smaller. (better)

* Loading is broken after midi refactoring.

* "Play song from start" only plays block 0 one time. (doesn't matter whether block 0 is first or last in playlist)
  Could seem like playlist in radium is not updated from playlist GUI.

* After selecting a menu, doquit is not checked. (must press a key first to quit)
