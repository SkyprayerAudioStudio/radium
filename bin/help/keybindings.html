<h1>Custom keybindings</h1>
 
By editing $HOME/.radium/keybindings.conf, you can add custom keybindings.
<p>


Example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
*
import radium as ra
*

Z CTRL_L : ra.openAboutWindow
</pre>
</blockquote>

...will change left ctrl + z into open the about window instead of undoing.
<b>Z</b> was the name of the key, while <b>CTRL_L</b> was the qualifier key.

<p>

  A key binding definition must start with the name of a key, followed by 0 or more qualifiers.<br>
  The qualifiers are <b>CTRL_R</b>, <b>SHIFT_L</b>, <b>SHIFT_R</b>, <b>EXTRA_L</b>, <b>ALT_L</b>, <b>ALT_R</b>, <b>MOUSE_EDITOR</b>, <b>MOUSE_MIXER</b>, <b>MOUSE_SEQUENCER</b>, and <b>UP</b>.<br>
  The <b>MOUSE_EDITOR</b> qualifier is true if the mouse pointer is placed in the editor, and so forth.<br>
  The <b>UP</b> qualifier is true when releasing the key instead of pressing it.

<p>

Radium needs to be restarted for the new keybindings to take effect.

<p>
  
  For more examples, look at <A href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmatheussen/radium/master/bin/keybindings.conf">the default keybindings.conf file</A>,
  and look at <A href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmatheussen/radium/master/api/protos.conf">protos.conf</A> for a complete list of available functions.

<p>
  If you want to run <A href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html">S7 Scheme</A> code, or <A href="http://www.python.org">Python</A> code, use the functions ra.evalScheme or ra.evalPython:
  

<blockquote>
<pre>
*
import radium as ra
*

X CTRL_L : ra.evalPython "ra.openAboutWindow()"
C CTRL_L : ra.evalScheme "(ra:open-about-window)"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Note that any code between the asterisks are executed as python code when Radium starts up. ("import radium as ra" is pure python code). This makes it posssible to add custom functions and classes in a convenient way.
