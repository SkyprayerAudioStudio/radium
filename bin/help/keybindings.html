<h1>Custom keybindings</h1>
 
By editing $HOME/.radium/keybindings.conf, you can add custom keybindings.
<p>

  
Example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
*
import radium as ra
*

Z CTRL_L : ra.openAboutWindow
</pre>
</blockquote>

...will change left ctrl + z into open the about window instead of undoing.
<p>

Note that Radium needs to be restarted for the new keybindings to take effect.

<p>
  
For more examples, look at the file "bin/keybindings.conf" in the Radium distribution.
