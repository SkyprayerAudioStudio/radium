<h1>Chance text</h1>

Chance text lets you set the probability for this note or pitch to play.

<p>

  Chance text format: <b>xx</b>, where
  
<p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
1 = lowest velocity, ff = highest velocity. (hex format)
    </pre>
  </blockquote>
<p>

  Examples:
  <UL>
    <LI>xx = 80: 128/256 (50%) chance of this note playing
    <LI>xx =  0: Only play if the previous note played. For instance if wanting to play a chord with same chance.
    <LI>xx = ff: 255/256 (99.6%) chance of this note playing
  </UL>

<p>

  To remove a chance text (to make sure the note is always played), press DEL.
<p>
  
  To control the chance of individual voices in the note duplicator,
  you can automate the <b>System Chance 1</b>, <b>System Chance 2</b>, etc. effects instead.
  (Note that the value <b>ff</b> is interpreted as 256 when automating the chance
  of individual voices in the note duplicator so you don't have to worry about
  the voices not always playing.)
