<h1>Mixer Strips</h1>

<h2>Order</h2>
The order of the Mixer strips is not random, and it is not ordered by how the instruments were added either.
The sorting order has three stages:
<OL>
  <LI> Sort by connections. This ensures that the audio flow always goes from left to right.
  <LI> Sort by vertical position in the modular mixer.
  <LI> Sort by horizontal position in the modular mixer.
</OL>  

<p>

<h2>How to...</h2>
Q: Set accurate volum by writing a number?<br>
A: Click the number box right above the volume slider
<p>
Q: Reset highest peak value in the box above the audio meter?<br>
A: Just click the box.
<p>
Q: Add a new mixer strip?<br>
A: You can not do that directly in a mixer strips window. You either have to create a new instrument in the modular mixer, or add a new instrument to a track in the editor.
<p>
Q: Delete a mixer strip?<br>
A: Right-click the name of the mixer strip, and select "Delete".
