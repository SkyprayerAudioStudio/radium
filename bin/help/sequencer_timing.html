<h1>Timing</h1>

Timing in Radium means tempo (BPM) and time signature (for instance 3/4 or 4/4).<!-- From now on, we will use the word "signature" instead of "time signature". -->
<p>
Timing is sent in realtime to external plugins. For instance to a make a VST plugin play echo in synch with the music.
<p>
Timing is also the time source for the sequencer grid, the metronome ("Click"), and the modulators.

<p>

There are two timing modes:

<OL>
<LI><b>Editor timing.</b> (the default)<br>
In editor timing mode, timing and grid is provided by the editor blocks placed in the first seqtrack.
In this mode, the tempo and signature lanes in the sequencer are just used for visualization, and editing in any of these two lanes is disabled.

<LI><b>Sequencer timing.</b><br>
In sequencer timing node, timing and grid is provided by the tempo and signature lanes in the sequencer. If you are mainly using Radium for recording and playing back audio files,
this mode is simpler and easier to use than editor timing. This mode can be set explicitly in the popup menu of the sequencer,
but it will also be used automatically if the first seqtrack is for audio instead of editor blocks.
<p>
Note that accelerando and ritardando is not supported in this mode yet.
Two more limitations of the sequencer timing mode is that signatures must align with bars, and tempos must align with beats. Editor timing mode doesn't have these two limitations.

</OL>

To select timing mode, use the popup menu in the sequencer and either select "Editor timing" or "Sequencer timing".
Note that if the first seqtrack is for audio files, you are forced to use sequencer timing.
