<a name="what"></a><h2>What is timing?</h2>

Timing is tempo and rythm.

<a name="usage"></a><h2>What does Radium use timing for?</h2>

<a name="overview"></a><h2>How is timing controlled?</h2>

Timing is controlled by tempo events and signature events:
<UL>
<LI> <b>Tempos</b> (BPM) specify the duration of a quarter note. Note that BPM stands for <b>B</b>eats <b>P</b>er <b>M</b>inute, which is a misleading name unless your signature is 4/4. QPM (Quarters Per Minute) would be more correct.
<LI> <b>Signatures</b> specify rythm. It does so by specifying number of beats divided by bar duration (for instance 4/4). Bar duration is measured in number of quarter notes.
</UL>
<p>
For example, if tempo is set to 64 BPM, and the signature is set to 8/8, a new bar will be played every 16 seconds (64/4 * 8/8), and a new beat will be played every 2 seconds (64/4 * 1/8).
If the signature is set to 2/4, a new bar will be played every 8 seconds (64/4 * 2/4), and a new beat will be played every 4 seconds (64/4 * 1/4).

<a name="modes"></a><h2>Timing modes</h2>

There are two timing modes to select from. Only one of them can be enabled at the same time:

<OL>
<LI><b>Editor timing</b><br>
<p>
Editor timing is the default mode. In editor timing mode, tempos and signaturs are provided by the editor blocks placed in the first seqtrack.
<p>
Tempos are edited in the tempo tracks in the editor, and signatures are edited in the signature tracks in the editor.
<p>
In this mode, the tempo and signature lanes in the sequencer are just used for visualization, and editing in any of these two lanes is disabled.

<p>

<LI><b>Sequencer timing</b><br>
<p>
In sequencer timing mode, tempos and signatures are provided by the tempo and signature lanes in the sequencer.
This mode can be set explicitly in the popup menu of the sequencer,
but it will also be used automatically if the first seqtrack is for audio and not for editor blocks
<p>
If you are using Radium mainly for recording and playing back audio files,
this mode is both simpler, and probably easier to use, than editor timing.
<p>
Note that accelerando and ritardando is not currently supported in this mode.
Two more limitations of the sequencer timing mode is that signatures must align with bars, and that tempos must align with beats.
Editor timing mode does not have these three limitations.

</OL>

To select timing mode, use the popup menu in the sequencer and either select "Editor timing" or "Sequencer timing".
Note that if the first seqtrack is for audio files, you are always forced to use sequencer timing.
