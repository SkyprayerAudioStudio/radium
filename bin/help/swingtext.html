<h1>Swing</h1>

The Swing tracks provide efficient ways to create swing. There are two types of swing tracks:
<OL>
  <LI> <b>The global swing track.</b> <i>(to the right of the "LZ" track)</i><br>
    The global swing track applies swing to all tracks in a block.
  <LI> <b>Swing subtracks.</b> <i>(to the left of note text)</i><br>
    Swing subtracks applies swing to normal tracks, and overrides the global swing track for that track. Right click a track and enable "Swing text"
    to edit swing of individual tracks.
</OL>



<p>

  Swing text format: <b>xxt</b>, where
  
<p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
    
<b>xx</b> = Swing weight. 1 = lowest value, 99 = highest value.
<b>t</b>  = Whether to gradually change tempo to the next swing value. (Press 't' to switch)
  </pre>
  </blockquote>

  <LI> To stop swing in the middle of a block, add "1" (or any number) to the first beat in a bar, and remove all other swing values from that bar.
  <LI>To disable all swing in a block (can be used to quickly compare swing vs. non-swing), unselect the check box below "Swing" in the upper left part of the editor.
