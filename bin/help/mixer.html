<h1>Mixer Strips</h1>

<h3>Order</h3>
The order of the strips is not random or chronological. The sorting logic has four stages:
<OL>
  <LI> Sort by whether the strip is a bus or not. Non-buses are displayed first.
  <LI> Sort by vertical position in the modular mixer (top -> bottom).
  <LI> Sort by horizontal position in the modular mixer (left -> right).
  <LI> Slightly rearrange the strips order so that the audio flow always goes from left to right.
</OL>

<h3>How to...</h3>
Q: Set accurate volum by writing a number?<br>

<p>
Q: Reset highest peak value in the box above the audio meter?<br>
A: Just click the box.
<p>
Q: Add a new mixer strip?<br>

Q: Delete a mixer strip?<br>
A: Right-click a mixer strip, and select "Delete". Or shift+right click the name. Make sure the mouse pointer is not pointing at a plugin or a send.
