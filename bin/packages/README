!!! PLEASE DON'T ATTEMPT NOT TO USE ANY OF THE PACKAGES IN THIS DIRECTORY !!!

Replacing anything in here will MOST LIKELY make Radium UNSTABLE in (more or less) subtle ways. 
There are VERY good reasons for all of the packages included here.

Here are the reasons:

1. They are modified versions of upstream. (faust2, fluidsynth, gc/libatomic, libgig, libpd, qhttpserver, QScintilla, and Visualization-Library)
   (Yes, patches have been provided upstream.)
2. Almost no, or no, distribution provide the package (faust2, libpd, qhttpserver, qtstyleplugins, s7, and Visualization-Library).
   (Most of these overlap with the packages in point 1)
3. Needs to be compiled with custom options. (s7, Visualization-Library)
4. It is a newer version that not all distributions use, but must be used. (libxcb/xcb-proto).

In the case of libxcb, linking to older versions of libxcb.so WILL CRASH Radium
for many users. Using an older version of libxcb is probably the most
common reason Radium has crashed. And I know this because I get an email
with backtrace every time a user presses the "Send" button in the crash reporter window, which pops up when Radium crashes.
After including libxcb with the program, all crash reports caused by libxcb suddenly disappeared.
But if you know that the system version of libxcb is at least 1.12, this package can be safely removed. (Although, what's the point?)

In addition, there are several packages included with Radium in other directories than this one. (with good reasons for those as well)
For some reason, though, people are hung up on the packages included here, specifically. Could it be because of the name of the directory and the visibility of it?
Perhaps I should hid this directory a little bit so that these angry people wouldn't see it? This type of irrational angryness is probably not good for health.
