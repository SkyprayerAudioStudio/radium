Radium V1.9.35
Released 2014-01-08



HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

        Either (TAR):

          1. If you downloaded a tar-ball:

          "
          make packages
          BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j7
          ./start.sh
          "


        Or (GIT):

          2. If you checked out from a git repository:

          "
          touch audio/*.cpp common/gfx_op_queue_generated.c common/visual_op_queue_proc.h
          make packages
          BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j7
          ./start.sh
          "



IF YOU GOT THE SOURCE FROM GIT

   In general, after a git clone, you must also do:

          touch audio/*.cpp common/gfx_op_queue_generated.c common/visual_op_queue_proc.h

   And after a git pull, you must do:
          make very_clean

     (since not all dependencies are tracked in the makefile)



INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data.

      libqt4-dev
      qt4-dev-tools
      libxaw7-dev
      python2-dev
      libasound2-dev

      libvorbis-dev
      libspeex-dev
      fftw-dev
      fftw3-dev
      guile

      * Or in one line:

      sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev      qt4-dev-tools      libxaw7-dev       python2-dev       libasound2-dev       libjack-jackd2-dev     libsamplerate-dev       liblrdf-dev       libsndfile-dev      ladspa-sdk      glib2-dev      calf-plugins      binutils-dev      libc6-dev      tk8.5 libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libspeex-dev fftw-dev fftw3-dev guile


      * Ubuntu LTS: I needed glib-2.0-dev instead of glib2-dev, plus a package called libglib2.0-dev.
      I also needed to install python2.7-dev instead of python2-dev.

      * On debian stable, it has been reported that you also need guile-2.0-dev and libfftw3-dev.


TO ENABLE ALL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ON MAC OS X

      Then go to

          System Preferences -> Accessibility

     or

          System Preferences -> Universal Access

      ... and make sure the button "Enable access for assistive devices" is ON.    
      This button is placed at the bottom of the Accessibility page.
      (I don't know where the button is placed in the "Universal Access" page)

      This is necessary for Radium to be allowed to (temporarily) turn off OSX system shortcuts.
