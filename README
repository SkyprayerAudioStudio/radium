Radium V0.65.9
Released 2012-07-21


HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

make
./start.sh



INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data.

CHANGES
=======

Most important changes 0.65.8 -> 0.65.9:
* Fix race condition for midi input
* Remove memory allocation in the rtmidi jack process
* Fix broken ringbuffer implementation in rtmidi. (Quick fix, it's probably still
  broken on some (or all) platforms. Planning to use the portaudio ringbuffer implementation
  in a later commit.)


Most important changes 0.65.6 -> 0.65.8:
* Midi input editing.
* Removed the custom resize window box. (extremely buggy, and not very useful)
* midi: increased latency from 1.95ms to 5ms. (This should probably be configurable)


Most important changes 0.65.0 -> 0.65.6:
* Setting port for instrument will not crash the program
* Many build improvements
* Blocklist and Playlist are properly updated when loading standard midi file.
* Sample accurate jack midi
* Accurate mouse coordinates
* Closing the xterm window will not lock the program
* Options to turn off overriding of Qt colors and Qt style
* Fast jack port probing
* Only create one jack client
* Works even if python links to python3 instead of python2
* Fixed All Sounds Off menu option
* Graphics fully updated after using menu
