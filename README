Radium V1.9.14
Released 2012-12-07



HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

        If you downloaded a tar-ball:

        "
        make packages
        BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j7
        ./start.sh
        "


        If you checked out from a git repository:

        "
        touch audio/*.cpp common/gfx_op_queue_generated.c common/visual_op_queue_proc.h
        make packages
        BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j7
        ./start.sh
        "


INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data.

TO ENABLE ALL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ON MAC OS X

      Then go to

          System Preferences -> Accessibility

     or

          System Preferences -> Universal Access

      ... and make sure the button "Enable access for assistive devices" is ON.    
      This button is placed at the bottom of the Accessibility page.
      (I don't know where the button is placed in the "Universal Access" page)

      This is necessary for Radium to be allowed to (temporarily) turn off OSX system shortcuts.
