Radium V0.63 Alpha Linux Port 
Released 15.4.2004


HOW TO MAKE IT RUN WITHOUT READING THE REST OF THE README FILE

make
./start.sh



INTRODUCTION
	This is the second public, and the first official, release of
	the linux port of the music editor Radium. The Amiga version
	has been stable since January 2002.

	Radium is a new type of graphical (currently only) notebased
	music editor.

	For more info about the program, check out the online manual placed
	at http://www.notam02.no/radium/ somewhere.



COMPILE
	The following packages are currently used to build and run Radium:

	*libgc - http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
	*Python - www.python.org (at least V2.0 and tkinter)
	*Python development package
	*pyqt - http://www.gnu.org/directory/devel/specific/PyQT.html
	*pygtk - http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/ (pygtk1, use pygtk-0.6.11)
	*xterm - Yupp.

	Most of these things are allready included in the radium/ directory (mainly because
	of compatibility problems between various versions of gtk, pygtk and
	libglade), so you only need to get hold of "pyqt".

	"pyqt" is available as package for most linux distributions.


CURRENT STATE
	The biggest problem is that saving does not work. Loading does though.
	Other things that needs to be fixed is that the playing behaves
	strange when reaching the end of the blocks, and that the alsa-seq code
	needs some care (midi/alsaseq/).


ABOUT THE CODE
	The code is a mix between C and Python. The state of some of the code is
	quite horrible and ununderstandable, but relatively bug-free, eh
	hopefully. :)
