Bug reporting template
======================

### 1. Steps to reproduce the problem.

Make a recipe in the following format:

* Step 1. Start Radium. (This should always be step 1)
* Step 2. Do something
* ...
* Step 9. This happened: ... But I expected ... to happen.

Also inform whether this always happens, sometimes happens, almost never happens, or if it only happened once.

When making a recipe like this, you often include crucial steps that you wouldn't have thought of othervice.

In addition, reporting a bug this way should be easier. It also makes the job much easier for the programmers,
plus that we usually avoid many follow-up questions.

### 2. Which version of Radium are you using? Do you know if an earlier version has worked?

### 3. If relevant, which operating system did you run Radium on?
