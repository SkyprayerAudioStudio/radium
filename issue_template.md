If you are requesting a new feature, just delete all this text.

If you are reporting a bug, please use the template below.

When making a step-by-step recipe, you often include crucial
steps that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

It's hard to know what's relevant, so just describe all steps
down to the smallest detail.

In addition, reporting a bug this way should be easier.
It also makes the job much easier for the programmers,
plus that we avoid many follow-up questions.
