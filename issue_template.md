If you are a subscriber requesting a new feature, please make sure I know who you are.
You do that by emailing me your github user name. Feature requests by non-subscribers
are likely to be ignored.

If you are reporting a bug, please use the template below.
The most important part of the template is the step-by-step
recipe. When making a step-by-step recipe, you often include
crucial steps that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.
It's hard to know what's relevant, so just describe all steps
down to detail. Reporting a bug this way makes the job
easier both for you and me, and we avoid many follow-up
questions.
