* Don't send pitch change messages when the value is the same as
  last time. Minor optimization + that it screwed up automatic
  portamento a little bit.

  popup menu.
* Ensure graphics is updated when changing song tempo automation.



Changes 4.2.8 -> 4.2.9:
* More fixes for open hand mouse pointer.
* Removed some startup warnings about unstable gfx drivers
  and so forth on Linux. With latest version of libxcb,
  this will hopefully not be a problem anymore.
* Linux: Include xcb-proto 1.12 and libxcb 1.12. All versions
  of xcb before 1.11.1 (which is quite new) are probably
  unstable if using AMD or Intel gfx drivers.
* Fix high CPU usage when sequencer window is visible



Changes 4.2.7 -> 4.2.8:

  the arrow keys, and 4. When playing using the computer keyboard.
  Also add option to the preferences to keep original MIDI channel
  when using MIDI keyboard.
* Use the system font height to determine sequencer dimensions, not the
  editor font height.
* Send actual time to plugins. I.e. remove block tempo multiplication
  and song tempo automation out of the picture.

* Song tempo automation



Changes 4.2.6 -> 4.2.7:
* Make fewer undo points when moving sequencer blocks
* Attempt to lower file requester startup time on windows
* Show sequencer grid graphically when moving blocks
* Only use first sequencer track to define grid
* Scrolling the mouse wheel down stops the player and
  sets cursor position in the sequencer.

  I.e. already playing notes doesn't suddenly change
  between playing backards and forwards.
* Fix "Block Copy" and "Block Paste" in the menus
* Fix semi-rare crash that could happen right after
  a sequencer is deleted or changed, for instance after
  loading a song.
* Fix sequencer grid when a block tempo multiplier doesn't
  have the value 1.0.
* Update note graphics in the sequencer immediately.
* Configure instrument colors (select "Configure color"
  from the track header or mixer sound object popup menus).

  It seems like Radium could crash at any time if using
  these drivers.
* Possibly improve audio performance by reducing cache misses.
  Memory usage has decreased a little bit too.



Changes 4.2.5 -> 4.2.6:
* Mouse: Don't bar-align the first block in the sequencer.
* Mouse: Always move the sequencer blocks the same number of pixels.
* Option to recalculate latency on the fly when turning on/off
  a bus connection. Saves a lot of CPU on songs with many instruments.
  This is probably just a temporary workaround for the CPU problem
  until a proper solution is implemented. Latency should not be
  recalculated when you turn on/off of a bus connection since
  it produces minor artifacts (caused by interpolation) and also
  causes minor temporary tempo changes (i.e. at least one beat will
  have a different length than the surrounding beats).
* Fix mouse problems when moving sequencer blocks. A very common
  problem on OSX, but it has also been observed on Linux.
* Fix rare assertion window popup when loading song.



Changes 4.2.4 -> 4.2.5:

* Move sequencer blocks in the vertical direction as well as the
  horizontal direction.
* Always hide sequencer window if instrument window is half or
  full size.
* Let new blocks have 64 lines by default, not 70.
* Mouse: Align sequencer blocks by bar positions in the sequencer
  track(s) above. Pressing ctrl (to finetune) prevents automatic
  alignment.
* Update default sequencer colors.
* Legalize sequencer block positions when timing has been changed.
* Paint bars and beats in the sequencer.
* Fix rare hang when loading song or protracker module.
* Don't show assertion reporter if the user doesn't have physical
  jack output ports.

  sequencer.
* Options to replace block under mouse with current/existing/new
  block, in sequencer popup menu.
* Add "configure block" option to sequencer block popup menu.
* Option to configure block colors. Block colors are also saved
  to disk.
* Hide progress window when showing message so that it doesn't
  cover the message window.
* Regularly make sure progress window is on top when open.

  triggered by MIDI or computer input.
* Don't multiply tempo with the block tempo multiplier of
  block #0 when pausing.
* Unique block colors in the sequencer.
* Various sequencer navigator GFX tweaks.
* Option to lock juce when swapping opengl. Might prevent some
  plugins from crashing when opening native GUI.

* Tweak sequencer "piano roll" painting.
* Ensure scheduler is really cleared before starting to play.
  Should prevent the assertion reporter from popping up in
  some situations.
* Ask VST3 and AU plugins for audio tail length instead of
  using default value.



Changes 4.2.2 -> 4.2.3:
* Switch editor block when clicking a block in the sequencer
* Draw blue border around current block in the sequencer
* Pd: fix a bug that happened when loading long lines. The bug could
  for instance cause mininum and maximum slider values to be lost.

  operations.
* Fix a division by zero occurence in the Editor renderer.



Changes 4.2.0 -> 4.2.1:
* Update block play positions in the playlist after changing
  a block length. (Bug introduced in 4.1.7)


Changes 4.1.9 -> 4.2.0:
* Use less time deleting plugins that have thousands of parameters
* Remove a couple of situations where the assertion reporter
  popped up unnecessarily.
* Fix loading songs that contain AU and VST3 plugins.
* Disable changing presets for VST3 plugins, at least for now
  since it's not working.



Changes 4.1.8 -> 4.1.9:
* Play block when selecting a block in the block selector.
  It didn't work before when playing song.
* Warn about old Intel Linux GFX driver during startup.
* Reorganize the instrument header buttons.

* Show the "Reset" option when trying to reset the current
  a/b setting setting. Display it in disabled mode though.
  (It was a bit confusing when nothing happened before.)



Changes 4.1.5 -> 4.1.6:
* Don't fill up undo log when adding undo for all effects of an instrument.

  playing.
* Mixer: Remove the "Zoom in" and "Zoom out" buttons.
* Mixer: "Reset Zoom" -> "<snake-arrow>Zoom".
* Mixer: "Show CPU usage" -> "CPU"
* import mod: Fix looping when looping from last line of pattern



Changes 4.1.4 -> 4.1.5:
* MIDI instrument: Fix bug that caused midi channel 2 to be send out
  at channel 3, channel 3 to be sent out at channel 4, and so forth.
* Option to assign MIDI channel to track. Can be convenient for some
  VST instruments. Ignored by the MIDI instrument.
* Display MIDI channel 1-16 instead of 0-15 in the MIDI messages instrument.
  (Radium has always used 1->16 for MIDI channel.)
* Paint solid bars for the peak meters in the mixer, not just single lines.
* Let the MIDI messages plugin receive notes from the editor, and add
  channel value to the notes.
* Fix sliders in the FaustDev instrument when pressing "half" or "full".
* Still show automation values in the sliders after selecting "half"/"full".
* Don't open the window informing about new versions modally since this
  can block starting up the program if another window opens on top of it.
* Fix peak colors when db > 0 (i.e. show yellow and red too, not just green).



Changes 4.1.3 -> 4.1.4:
* Fix various crashes happening after loading a song
  or a preset that was saved with Radium 4.1.3.
* Don't crash during startup if a popup window is
  shown right after splash screen is hidden. (Bug
  introduced in 4.1.3)
* Turn on the "Briefly pause rendering when opening windows"
  option if using an AMD or Intel card on Linux
  (Can be turned off manually).
* Make it possible to configure color for the left part
  of the track separators. (The left part was hardcoded
  to black color before.)
* Use correct rgb color mixing algorithm.
  (i.e. "sqrt(m*c1^2 + (1-m)*c2^2)")
* Put the "Show controls" check box and sample browser
  back to the old positions in the instrument widget.



Changes 4.1.2 -> 4.1.3:
* Hide splashscreen if showing a message during startup.
* Always autosuspend buses, pipes, patchbay instruments, and the
  sampler instrument.
* Buttons for doing A/B testing (A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H testing).
* Don't autosuspend current instrument when not playing.
  (Annoying to look at flickering mixer objects.)
* Add a close button to the MIDI learn configuration window.
* Rearrange plugin parameters when changing size between
  normal/half/full. (Show less tabs in half or full mode).
* Fix display of CPU usage for the current instrument when
  showing CPU usage in the mixer.
* Don't write "Auto-suspended" immediately in the top of the
  instrument widget when instrument is auto-suspended.
  Use the normal cpu usage update interval. (Less flickering)
* Never shrink the note duplicator widget. Always let
  it have the same size.
* Fix saving a song which had previously been saved with
  embedded samples.
* Show restart instructions when jack is not running properly.
* Option not to stop playing when saving song.
* Do autobackups even while playing. (Can be turned off in
  the preferences window.)
* Never grey out editor when editing colors, even if the
  editor doesn't have keyboard focus.
* Fix undo/redo for system effect parameters.
* Thicker track borders.
* Lighter default track border color.
* Start/continue/stop playing when receiving MIDI
  start/continue/stop messages.
* Fix some always-on-top-of-main-window issues.



Changes 4.1.1. -> 4.1.2:
* Rename auto-bypass to auto-suspend.
* Optionally show CPU usage per instrument in the mixer.
* Fix MIDI input-related crash when deleting instrument. Bug introduced
  in 4.1.1
* Let Notes added by MIDI input be polyphonic when shift is pressed.
* Fix bug causing both note on and note off be registered as note on
  when a note was added from MIDI input.
* Add inputs/outputs/latency/tail/time of last last activity to the
  instrument info box.
* Grey out auto-suspending sound objects in the mixer, in realtime.
* Various auto-suspend tweaks and bug fixes
* By default, disable auto-suspend for zita reverb in new songs.
* Instruments can optionally override default auto-suspend behavior.
* Autoposition instruments in the mixer (again) when importing MOD.
* Fix general buggy behavior when closing text line requesters.
* Allow cancelling adding a new MIDI port.
* Many bug fixes and tweaks for auto-suspend.
* Show requester windows at mouse position.
* Let Escape key exit editing number boxes



Changes 4.1.0 -> 4.1.1:
* Option to auto-bypass instruments. The feature turns off processsing for
  an instrument when it has been inactive for a specified amount of time,
  i.e. when it has not received or produced any audio or events.
  This can save lots of CPU. Note that this bypass is not the same as
  the mixer-bypass. The mixer-bypass only turns down the volume,
  but it doesn't turn off processing.
* Fix bug causing assertion reporter to pop up when changing tempo etc.
  (bug introduced in 4.1.0)
* Run plugins also when dry/wet value is 0% or bypassing. If not,
  delaying plugins might cause old audio to suddenly kick in when
  unbypassing. Other artifacts may have occured too because of this.
* Upgraded s7 scheme interpreter to latest version.
* Fix startup crash if startup is interrupted.



Changes 4.0.9 -> 4.1.0:
* Add bypass button to native VST GUI windows
* Windows: Fix always-on-top for VST GUIs (i.e. avoid
  sub windows to appear behind the main VST GUI window).
* Add option to the preferences to disable always-on-top
  for VST GUIs.
* Fix latency compensation when dry/wet value is less than
  100%, or we are bypassing.
* Timeskew: Optionally report latency for positive skew values.
  (Practical when testing latency compensation)
* VST timing info: Ensure bar start value is correct when
  starting to play.
* Add plugin latency compensation to editor events (e.g. note
  on / note off, automation, pitch, etc.) when a plugin
  with latency is input-connected.
* Add latency compensation to VST timing data, if needed.
* Fix semi-rare startup crash introduced in 4.0.8.



Changes 4.0.8 -> 4.0.9:
* Use system font size to determine the height of the "Grab keyboard" check box
* Some ubsan fixes
* Don't show those tiny pitch lines if a track plays the same pitch for all notes
* Detect if instrument receives, generates, or sends out very powerful signals,
  and show a warning if they do.



Changes 4.0.7 -> 4.0.8:
* Add "Grab keyboard" checkbox to the VST GUI windows.
* Windows: Fix keyboard focus in VST plugins.
* Rename "Paste Preset(s)" to "Paste sound object(s)".



Changes 4.0.6 -> 4.0.7:
* Show load/paste preset and VST plugins first in instrument popup menu.
* Don't allow copying a permanent sound object to the clipboard.
  (i.e. a bus or the main pipe.)
* Fix autoconnect and auto position when creating new instrument
  from track header.



Changes 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6:
* Show note about autobackup in the preferences window.
  Autopackup is not performed while playing.
* Fix bug when pressing backspace at line 0 and the end position
  of a note was between line 0 and line 1.
* Disable minimize and maximze buttons on the GUI of native VST plugins.
  This fixes strange situation when putting VST plugin in full screen on OSX.
* Only render soundfile if there is a "System Out" instrument in the mixer.
* Cut/copy/paste sound objects
* Load/save multiple presets
* Fix very small timing error when block multiplier does not have
  the value 1.0. This means that older songs with a block
  multiplier != 1.0 will not play correctly, although it is
  likely not noticable.
* Don't show assertion reporter when recording failed.
* Fix selecting "Reset" when right clicking on a slider.
* sample recording: Set middle note in smpl chunk instead
  of setting an uncommon sample rate.
* Get middle note from the "instr" chunk, if it exists,
  and there was no "sampl" chunk. Untested though, since I don't
  have a sound file with "an nstr" chunk.
* Get middle note from the "sampl" chunk in wav files, if present.
* Start audio recording sample accurately.
* Update peaks in realtime when recording audio.



Changes 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5:
* Fix modifier keys on OSX.
* Don't crash if deleting the instrument while recording audio.



Changes 4.0.3 -> 4.0.4:
* Revert most of the keyboard changes in 4.0.3 since it caused various problems.
  However, although detecting autorepeat on linux doesn't quite work now,
  on OSX and Windows the functionality should be the same as in 4.0.3, apart
  from the bugs.
* Option to record audio into sampler instrument. (Hard drive, multitrack recording)
* Some attempts to track down and prevent one autopeported crash when deleting instrument.



Changes 4.0.2 -> 4.0.3:
* Fix player pausing when using play cursor (noticable for instance
  when changing tempo while playing)
* Option to render range to soundfile
* Only show .rad files in file requester when saving song
* Make alt+w/ctrl+w widen automation area(s) as well,
  not just the note area.
* Attempts to fix reported startup crash using debian + OpenGL 2.0.
* play range: Ensure nothing is played below the range. (It could
  sometimes happen before). There is still a little delay right
  before starting to play the range again (when looping),
  but this delay has been reduced significantly.
* Fix program freeze that could happen if trying to play a very
  small range, block or song. (range/block/song length must probably
  be less than 5 milliseconds)
* Very simple fx quantization. (Keep last value only)
* Add "Add automation to current track" slider option
* VST: Automatically switch tab when changing parameter in external GUI
* Only disable keyboard autorepeat when playing samples.
* velocity text: Dont show last velocity value if the previous node was non-glide.
  (to avoid unnecessary "xxx" values)
* Windows: Remove "AltGr -> play block" from the menues since it often doesn't work.
* The FaustDev instrument has been removed from the Linux binaries for now.
  Hopefully this makes the Linux binaries run on Ubuntu 16.
* Workarounds to avoid crashes in the TAP reflector plugin, and possibly
  other TAP plugins.
* Actually reduce crackling when playing an instrument for the first time
  if using very low jack buffer size, or the CPU is very busy.
  (It was only applied in the debug builds in 4.0.2.)
* Include fftw3 libraries in the Windows and OSX releases.
  Many additional LADSPA plugins are loading now. Pitch shifters, etc.



Changes 4.0.1 -> 4.0.2:
* Slider text: show value set by the user, not the current
  value. (The current value can be also be set automation).
* Reduced instrument memory usage significantly.
* Reduce crackling when playing an instrument for the first time
  if using very low jack buffer size, or the CPU is very busy.
* Fix quick-selecting preset.



Changes 4.0.0 -> 4.0.1:
* Ignore keyboard when the mixer has focus
* Ignore keyboard when the blocklist or playlist has focus
* Support drag-dropping audio files
* Support drag-droping preset files

  a popup menu is show with the existing presets in the last used preset directory,
  plus an option to load a preset from a different directory.
* MIDI learn can also lear from input event connections.
* MIDI Messages instrument: Fix CC values for the general purpose controllers.
  The instrument sent out 16/17/18/19 instead of 80/81/82/83.
* Fix MIDI port name display in the MIDI learn configuration window.
* Grey out editor when editor doesn't have keyboard focus.
* Desparate attempt to find a workaround for rare OSX startup crash.
  (Please report if OSX still sometimes crashes on startup.)
* Fix crash during startup on OSX when jack is not running.
* Don't show assertion window when trying to load non-working preset file.
* OSX: Don't wait for diagnotic report in the crashreporter when we show assertion
  instead of crash. Before this fix, the crashreporter window popped up at least
  20 seconds after the assertion happened, and therefore a provided user
  description about what happened could be quite useless.
* Fix double scroll wheel events, and possibly other types
  of doubly reported mouse events as well. (Qt5 fix)
* Experimental option to prepare opengl data in separate thread. This helps making
  rendering smooth when there's lots of graphical data. Turned off by default.
* Fix mouse drag not always working when dragging too fast
  or gfx is slow because of much graphical data. (Qt5 fix)
* Increase rendering performance for blocks with many lines.
  Changing the LZ value shouldn't change performance that much anymore.



Changes 3.9.9 -> 4.0.0:
* Automation record: Don't show assertion warning when trying (and failing)
  to add a new fx automation point at the same time position as an already
  existing fx automation point.
* Thicker non-line-aligned beat lines. (0.6 pixels -> 2.3 pixels)
* Fix memory corruption when rendering block with non-line-aligned
  beat lines.
* Option to render multiple sound files, one for each instrument.
* Fix memory corruption when using VST plugins. (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Fix rare startup crash. (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Fix crash when removing the system out instrument or loading
  a song where the system out instrument has been removed.
  (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Reorganize project menu a little bit.
* Fix note duplicator horizontal gui stretch.
* Fix play cursor following. It didn't always follow.
* Keep sample read position when switching from ping-pong
  to non-ping-pong while playing.
* Fix a MIDI record position inaccuracy which could happen
  when switching to a block with a different length than the
  previous one.



Changes 3.9.8 -> 3.9.9:
* Don't let shift + mouse scroll wheel move editor cursor left/right.
* Cut/copy/paste individual fx-es in tracks.
* Record automation. (right-click a slider)
* Changed default play cursor color to black, and increased width to 4 pixels.
* Ensure the bottom bar volume slider is always updated.
* Don't show assertion window when loading older song with fxs->effectnum != fxs->fx->effect_num
* Fix track cut
* Fix copying/pasting/cutting tempo tracks

* Fix MIDI instrument widget stretch
* No 2-3 seconds freeze on Windows after starting up.



Changes 3.9.7 -> 3.9.8:
* Turn off custom put-dialog-in-front system. Using the Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint flag instead.
  (Less weird behavior when raising windows in front of others.)
* Fix "Make track monophonic". It didn't handle velocities and pitch changes,
  and it didn't create undo data at the correct time.
* Fix race condition when recording MIDI (fix rare crash).
* OSX: Fix VST plugin keyboard focus for qt5.
* Don't estimate monitor refresh rate when using qt5. The estimation is technically
  necessary since we need to know the refresh rate according to the sound card
  clock, and not the gfx card clock. But in practice it makes no difference since
  we interpolate the screen position anyway to avoid jumps. In qt5 there is a
  single function call to get the refresh rate without having to measure
  or dive into the OS APIs.
* Faust: Allocate hash tables with malloc to avoid large .bss sections
  (This causes shorter garbage collector pause times.)
* BDW-GC: Don't include data segments for dynamically loaded libraries.
  (This causes shorter garbage collector pause times.)
* Use Qt::FramelessWindowHint instead of Qt::Popup for the progress window,
  to avoid locking up the X server on Linux.
* Removed some unnecessary paint calls



Changes 3.9.6 -> 3.9.7:
* Fixed mod/xm import on OSX.
* OSX: dont show dock icons for the helper programs
* Clean up gfx update handling a bit. Should improve graphical performance.
* Remove some pre-opengl gfx buffers that were not used. Using less memory now,
  and resizing might be noticable faster.
* macosx: Enable full screen. Doesn't crash now, probably because of using Qt5 instead of Qt4.
* Progress dialog when opening songs.
* Option to save song with audio samples embedded. Works for the Sampler and
  Fluidsynth instruments. Could be useful when sending songs to other people
  or transfer songs between computers.
* Add Reverse and Ping-Pong loop to the sampler instrument
* Fix graphics for show/hide bpm track and tempo multiplier track
* Double the number of effect columns before using tabs.
* Tweak Patchbay gui a bit.
* Adjusted tapiir gui.
* Removed the custom Ctrl+C handler. Ctrl+C seems to work properly now without it.
* OpenGL: Call glMakeCurrent / glDoneCurrent before and after rendering each frame.
  Before we only called glMakeCurrent during program startup.
  Don't know if it makes a difference.
* disk: Give error message if the last step when saving
  a file (i.e. copying new file over the old file) failed.
* Fix bug that could cause non-glide automation not to be played.
* Force additional windows, such as the preferences window,
  to always display in front of the main window.
* Upgrade to Qt5. It seems like the seemingly
  random OpenGL related crashes are gone now.
* Some blocklist/playlist gfx tweaks
* Don't ask for effect display value string when
  the effect is an on/off button (crash fix)
* Fix pasting effects from other instruments
* Tweak when to paint stipled automation node lines



Changes 3.9.5 -> 3.9.6:
* Update bus slider strings immediately when changing a bus instrument name
* Fix freeze that could happen when pasting tracks and other situations
* Fix crash when pasting block using a sampler instrument pointing
  to a directory with lots of samples.

* Optimize rendering performance. Should especially be noticable
  on Windows 32 computers with slow disk.
* Apply faust scroll wheel behavior to the mixer and editor as well,
  and document this behavior in the help menu.
* Don't record CPU usage data for plugins that are not visible.
* Draw missing horizontal lines to connect nodes where glide is set to OFF.
  This is not only visually better, but also necessary in order
  to show the last values without enabling text.
* Update mute/solo/bypass buttons when automated
* Upgrade BDW garbage collector to 7.4.4
* More detailed information when getting "unknown effect number" error.
* Add missing sustain pedal effect name handling in
  the Fluidsynth instrument.
* Fix memory leak in FaustDev undo.
* Fix splitting block while playing
* Check errors when reading file from disk
* Gray out selected objects in the mixer again.



Changes 3.9.4 -> 3.9.5:
* Fix Linux binary

* FaustDev instrument. Develop faust instruments inside Radium.
* Instrument maximimize button.
* Faust instruments GUI button. Only the blue style available for now.
* Add separator between plugin and system effects in the effect popup menu.
* Start counting tab pages from 0 (not 1) in the plugin effect widgets.
* Don't play if pressing shift or altgr when the cursor is placed in a text field.
* Load song: Inform user when the effect names of a plugin has changed and
  will be ignored.
* LADSPA/Linux: Search for plugins in LADSPA_PATH (and bin/ladspa) before
  searching in the default locations.
* Don't create undo data when loading song, and when exiting.
* Ensure faust effect names are unique. Important when saving and
  loading songs since effects values are stored by name, not by index.
* Make sure editor is updated when the instrument widget automatically
  adjusts its height.


Changes 3.9.2 -> 3.9.3:
* Fix crash when changing the pitch of a note
* Don't show assertion window when a midi device
  name read from config file could not be found.

  on non-existing track
* Fix keybindings in the menu for switching track on/off and track solo.
* Prefix LADSPA and VST effect names with effect number to ensure
  effect names are always unique.
* Some midi recording fixes. Might fix rare crashes.


Changes 3.8.9 -> 3.9.0:
* Make sure cursor is placed correctly when switching blocks
* Dont show warning window when a vst plugin sends a MIDI sysex message
* Fix block switch crash introduced in 3.8.9
* Accept drag-and-dropped radium songs into the editor


Changes 3.8.8 -> 3.8.9: (removed, unstable)

* More than one MIDI input port simultaneously.
* Show most used plugins in the bottom of the pluginmenu.
  (All previously used plugins are shown in the "next" sub menues.)

  (they take up space and the patchbay is better anyway)
* Some assertions to try to hunt down ladspa initialization crash on osx
* Ensure current line is legal when changing the LZ value

* api: currentLine / setCurrentLine
* Make scroll wheel behave as pressing up / down arrow key
  instead of scrolling up / down
* Paint current connections in more distinct colors
* Fix 1L1 key on apple keyboards. On ISO keyboards the 1L1 key
  has moved down to the ZL1 key. Dont know how to detect whether
  we are using an apple or iso keyboard, but mac users probably
  usually use apple keyboards.
* OSX: Enable and fix crashreporter
* Wait until opengl widget has updated before returning
  from gl_create_window
* mouse: Fix editing lines below LZ * number of lines in block.
* Another attempt to fix window reconfiguration crash on osx.

  reduce memory usage. (Tito Latini)
* Don't disable garbage collector when loading song. Can significantly
  reduce memory usage.
* Improve mouse performance significantly. This may reduce overall

* Fix windows startup.
* Fix playing note when editing in the piano roll for a MIDI instrument,
  and similarly, fix playing note when editing in the piano roll for
  an audio instruments that uses pitch instead of note id to identify
  which sound to turn off (e.g. fluid synth and VST instruments).

  by default now, since it's probably (i.e. hopefully) only necessary
  if using older AMD or Intel drivers on Linux.
* Save note duplicator data + forward events into preset files,
  plus clone these data when cloning instruments
* Refactor audio instrument creation / deletion / etc. Major change.
  Radium should be more stable when creating and deleting instruments.

  also when the editor doesn't have keyboard focus.
* Read all colors from config file during startup,
  to avoid reading config file during playback
* mouse: Must press shift to delete pitch
* pianoroll: Show correct notename for highest visible note (not the note above)
* Use already stored value when adding new fx, not mouse position.
  (Not when adding fx to a MIDI instrument though.)

  createVelocity -> createVelocityF, createVelocity3 -> createVelocity,
  createFx -> createFxF, createFxNode3 -> createFxNodeF, etc.

  ever happened though)


Changes 3.7.2 -> 3.7.4:
* osx: Fix modifier keys when clicking mouse
* Hack fixes for positioning leftmost track.
  We dont show half-tracks anymore on the leftmost part of the editor since its both
  confusing for the user and complicated to implement.

* Handle corner case situation where if we play really extremely
  fast (probably a billion times faster than anyone ever will
  ever have use for), editor stops moving.
* Make velocity text a bit more yellow/brown

  It is also enabled automatically if there are notes with cents not equal to 0, and other "text" tracks.
* Don't paint pianoroll if it's to the left of the track area.
* Recreate sound object if pasting a track using a deleted sound object
  (This also fixes crash if the track with the deleted sound object contained FX)
* Use floats for transpose in the note duplicator. Step also changed from 1 to 0.25.
* osx: Disable fullscreen (since it makes the program crash)
* player: Possible to change play position while playing

  None of those works properly (or at all) with Qt on windows.
* Render: Draw range better
* Copy/cut/paste automation range
* Render: Disabled red "Rec" update, cause it caused block to be rendered
  twice when switching block during playback.

  Old songs are converted automatically when loading, but songs that glide to a note in a different
  block must be converted manually. This is not warned about though.
* Try to set default mixer zoom level based on system font size, plus always use font size 12
* Fix mouse state after right clicking a piano note
* Fix selecting and moving more than one sound object at once

* Fix crash during startup on windows 32 bit.
  Bug (re)introduced in 3.3.0 (the NDEBUG option again).
* Fix a copy-and-paste error which caused ppqPositionOfLastBarStart
  to always have the value 0.0. Might make a difference
  on some VST plugins.
* Automatically uncheck the "GUI" button in the instrument
  widget if the native plugin gui was closed by closing
  the window directly.



Most important changes 3.2.9 -> 3.3.0
* Windows: Turn off jack "-S" checking in production again. Still doesn't work.
* Don't inform more than one time about a newer version of radium
* Removed comment in the preferences dialog about MultiCore being
  an experimental feature. It seems stable.
* windows: Use a home made jack process thread to make the unhandled
  exceptions filter work also when crashing in the main audio thread.
* Pause the gl thread for a second when opening a new window or dialog.
  This might prevent some crashes caused by buggy gfx driver
* Turn off modal windows by default for AMD/catalyst and Intel drivers

Most important changes 3.2.8 -> 3.2.9
* Windows: Don't start crash reporter all the time when loading and using VST plugins.
  Bug was introduced in V3.2.5
* VST: load/save FXB and FXP files
* Fix note add bug. Dont make it polyphonic unless polyphonic is true. Bug was introduced in V3.2.4.
* Update instrument widget after undo/redo (fix for non-moving peaks after undoing/redoing)

* Do automatic backup every minute if there are unsaved edits and radium is not playing.
  The backup interval can be changed in the preferences. It can also be turned off.
* Replaced a bunch of calls to RError with calls to GFX_Message
  (RError was used the wrong way, causing uses messages to be reported as program errors)
* Always show message if there is a disk error
* Write to temporary file first if saving to an existing file to avoid destroying an
  existing file if saving fails
* Tried to improve stability after jack has shut down. Still not working well though.
  User should not do anything else than save and exit if jack shuts down.
* Fix plugin names in crashreporter when running multi core



Most important changes 3.2.7 -> 3.2.8
* Remove sound object from mixer before freeing buffers (might fix mysterious crashes)
* Fix audio glitches when changing number of CPUs
* Show the crash/assert window for most warning/error messages
* Fix a LADSPA bug where sometimes the effects were set to default after undoing a deletion.

  (juce::FloatVectorOperations::findMinAndMax)
* Made the CPU widget fixed size. The bottom bar doesn't move left and right anymore.
* Removed old sound object scheduling system. Everything now goes through
  through the multicore scheduler, even when running single-threadedly.
* Fixed realtime update of waveforms when changing track volume and track panning
* Rewrote bus system. Buses are now just hidden sound object connections. Can in some
  situations improve multicore performance.
* Draw current sound object in darker color when selecting with
  left button, not only right button


Most important changes 3.2.6 -> 3.2.7
* Mixer: Must press left mouse button on a sound object to select it. Dont just set the the one currently under the mouse.
* Added volume value to connections. This is both necessary to later optimize/simplify
  the bus system (especially in conjuction with multi core), and to be able to control the volume of a connection.
* Dont start making an audio connection in the mixer if the start pos doesnt have inputs or outputs
* Fixed a bug which could cause the program to freeze when deleting sound objects,
  loading songs, undoing, redoing, etc. Bug was introduced in V3.2.2.
  *** Radium between V3.2.2 and V3.2.6 are particulary unstable. ***
* Make sure song comment window is shown on top of all other windows after loading a song.



Most important changes 3.2.5 -> 3.2.6
* Fix: 1. General realtime performance, and: 2. Crashes when multicore is enabled.
  (Don't use QString in realtime code, and especially don't access the same QString from several threads simultaneously.)
  Bug introduced in 3.2.5.
* Always block crash/assert-reporter in non-RELEASE mode, and never block in RELEASE mode
* Avoid showing assert reporter when exiting after jack has shut down.


Most important changes 3.2.4 -> 3.2.5
* Start crashreporter also when just hitting an assert.
* Improved crash reporter. Should hopefully work better in Windows.
  The reports also includes a simple event log now.



Most important changes 3.2.3 -> 3.2.4
* Make all dialogs modal by default if using intel or binary amd driver on linux (to avoid crashes)
* Ensure all notes starts before they end, when recording from MIDI input.
* Various note positions and value validations
* Unset OPENSSL_CONF environment variable during startup. Fixes rare crashes during startup.



Most important changes 3.2.2 -> 3.2.3
* Fix qt version mismatch problem on linux binaries (and possibly windows and osx as well)
* windows: Fix search for missing "-S" argument for jackd.
* Replaced the use of QSemaphore with a native one based
  on this code: https://github.com/preshing/cpp11-on-multicore/blob/master/common/sema.h
  The previous code could in rare situations cause priority inversion.
* Improved multi core a lot. Seems to work fine on Windows now.



Most important changes 3.2.1 -> 3.2.2
* Show message during startup if there is a newer version of the program available.
* Reorganized the edit menu a little bit
* Moved show/hide line numbers configuration from the menues and into the preferences dialog
* Windows: Don't inform that Radium was unable to find jack process command line arguments in RELEASE builds
* "CPU": Show min/avg/max instead of just max. Useful while figuring out multi core implementation.
  (it's not working that well on Windows yet)
* Remove some unnecessary locking/waiting in the multicore scheduler
  (probably has very little impact on performance though)



Most important changes 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1
* Another default color scheme. A little bit darker and white text.
* Increase default font size from 10 to 11 to get less flickering when using a white-on-black color scheme
* Make color schemes with white text on black background look better.
* Shut down jack at the right moment. Avoids crash at exit.
* Fix some mixer UI/GUI issues.
* Changed various button handlers from "pressed" callbacks into "clicked" callbacks.
  Fixes buttons stuck in pressed state.
* Removed the "scrollplay" and "window update" options from the menues.
* Moved the MIDI preferences stuff from the MIDI menu and into the preferences dialog
* Band-aid to avoid crash if song is saved with a patch that has no corresponding chip.
* Tooltip for the quantization value in the MIDI post-recording dialog.
* Also delete elinks when deleting all connections, not just the links.
  Fixes crash if redoing an undoing of a deletion of a sound object.
* Improve multi core by running most cpu intensive sound objects first
* CPU: Show the maximum CPU usage which was measured during the last second,
  not just the current CPU usage.
* Include the custom qjackctl in the 32 bit windows binaries, not just
  the 64 bit binaries.



Most important changes 3.1.4 -> 3.2.0
* Include a custom version of qjackctl in the Windows version. (i.e the "Jack Command" program)
  Hopefully there will be less struggle to start jack now since this version has better default
  options and some bugs fixed.
* Ensure all source files are compiled with sse support (-mfpmath=sse -msse2) in the binaries.
* Move scrollplay and the "multiply etc." option into the preferences dialog under a new "Edit" tab.
* Save scrollplay in config file
* Rename the default "Chorus" and "Reverb" buses to "Corus Bus" and "Reverb Bus"
* Moved OpenGL, CPU and VST preferences into a new Preferences dialog.
* Dont stop processing plugins if using too much CPU. Some plugins might overcompensate when
  they start again. Instead just stop playing, and if that didn't help,
  stop processing plugins as well.
* Fix soundfile saving (don't stop because using too much CPU)
* Show warning message if unable to acquire real time priority
* Multithreaded audio processing (i.e. "Multi-core")



Most important changes 3.1.3 -> 3.1.4

* Add "replace" button to instrument widget
* Send inital values first time a "MIDI Messages" object is playing.
* Fix plugin info dialog
* VST: Update Radium sliders when changing controllers in native GUI.
  This indirectly causes automation to update the sliders as well, but that's actually
  what happens underneath for VST plugins too, so that's a good thing.
* Rendering: Reset gfx timing when jumping to the start of a block.
  (removes the "dragged by a spring" effect)
* Linux: Show info during startup about the Gallium AMD OpenGL driver (if using that driver)



Most important changes 3.1.2 -> 3.1.3
* Don't crash if reducing the number of lines in a block.
  (This also fixes some crashes when importing MIDI file)
